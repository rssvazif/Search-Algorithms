I'm very happy to share the steps for implementing some search algorithms in artificial intelligence, such as Breadth-First Search, various Depth-First Searches, Uniform Cost Search, and A-Star, with you through this repository. I would greatly appreciate it if you could share your feedback with me to help me become a better programmer. Thank you so much, and I wish you all the best!
